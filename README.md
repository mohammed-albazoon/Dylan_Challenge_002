# Dylan_Challenge_002

Your challenge habibi is to create a simple environment where I could do some data science work.

The trick will be you need to assume that I have no libraries or local environment on my computer.

Let's work with conda and pip to create a file, requirements.txt, that will allow me to install all the libraries I need to do my work.
